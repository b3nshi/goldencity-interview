# Goldencity Interview

## Backend

Backend folder contains a simple REST API to manage Notes.

- Within the folder you can find the instructions to run the project and a Postman Collection to test it.

## Frontend

Frontend folder contains the code of the repo https://github.com/BitrapX/goldencity

Changes I have implemented:

- Dark/Light mode
- Smooth animation to change modes
- Undeline the selected menu option
- Mobile menu style
- In mobile I adjusted some margin and spaces, but minor things
- Sticky Navigation bar

> I didn't understand the requirement to change the background - What is the new background we should use?

> Also the landing page is responsive, so I am not sure if I should be doing something else.
